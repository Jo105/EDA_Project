The Data Science Life Cycle goals for this project include: Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization and Predictive Modeling (by linear regression).

All parts of the data analysis are documented in the notebook “KCH_Prices_JP.ipynb” and include the following steps:

I. Import required Packages and the Dataset - our EDA will be based on [KC_House_Sales]( "kc_house_prices/King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv")

II. Data Understanding, Preparation and Munging<sup>1</sup>   
   - Data transforming
   - Data cleaning

III. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - General view over the characteristics
   - Going one by one through the varaiables

IV. Multiple Regression Model

V. Modelling by using Sklearn

VI. Summary
